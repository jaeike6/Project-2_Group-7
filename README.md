# Project-2_Group-7
This repo contains contributions from 4 collaborators to develop sql database for the 2017-2018 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. This database contains the information necessary to analyze team and player statistics and salary. To create the database, we performed ETL. The folder titled “dgooden” contains the raw data, jupyter notebook to extract and transform the data, and final clean data for the NBA season records. The folder titled “Jaeik” contains the raw data, jupyter notebook to extract and transform the data, and final clean data for the 2017-2018 player statistics and salary datasets. The folder “Project 2-Final” contains the jupyter notebook and schema to create the data tables and load the data into postgres. The folder “Ken“ contains additional table schema.
